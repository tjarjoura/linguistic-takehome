Some general thoughts as I worked on this:

1. I was initially worried about the case where a user submits an extremely large document. But after testing I found that the expressjs parser limits requests by default to 100kb, which is probably sufficient for uploading small to medium size articles. If need be we could increase this value, it's good to know that the limit is there.

2. I needed to read a few primers about NestJS and GraphQL before fully diving into this, since I have not worked with them before (in the past I have implemented REST APIs). Prisma was easier to pick up because I had used other ORMs before (Django). I would be curious what kind of performance problems we could run into down the line as we grow the complexity of the data types involved here.

3. There may be some problems down the line if users are loading all of the text of all of their documents at once. If the amount of data becomes too large, we could consider returning a list of document IDs or maybe a shortened version of the text until they request more. Not an issue at this scale but something to keep in mind for the future.
