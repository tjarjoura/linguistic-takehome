Some general thoughts as I worked on this:

1. I was initially worried about the case where a user submits an extremely large document. But after testing I found that the expressjs parser limits requests by default to 100kb, which is probably sufficient for uploading small to medium size articles. If need be we could increase this value, it's good to know that the limit is there.

2. There may be some problems down the line if users are loading all of the text of all of their documents at once. If the amount of data becomes too large, we could consider returning a list of document IDs or maybe a shortened version of the text until they explicitly request a specific document. Not an issue at this scale but something to keep in mind for the future.

3. I included an index for userId on the "docuemnts" table. This will it faster to lookup all of the documents for a given user, at the expense of making it more expensive to insert new documents. I assumed that users would spend more time consuming their existing documents rather than uploading new ones. In any case, this kind of optimization is not necessary at the scale of 10 users, but could be as usage grows. 

4. I noticed that the tests were broken, which seemed to be because of different import paths configured for jest vs tsc (src/ vs ./). After I updated that the tests started complaining when I used absolute import paths, so I made everything relative. I'm not sure but I think this may be what you're supposed to do? It's possible I messed things up there.

5. I needed to read a few primers about NestJS and GraphQL before fully diving into this, since I have not worked with them before (in the past I have implemented REST APIs). Prisma was easier to pick up because I had used other ORMs before (Django). I would be curious what kind of performance problems we could run into down the line as we grow the complexity of the data types involved here (for example, if there are additional nested relations inside of Document, and so on, it could result in a lot of DB queries).
